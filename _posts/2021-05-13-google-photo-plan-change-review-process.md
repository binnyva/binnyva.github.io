Do you use Google Photos? Are you aware that Google is [ending free storage](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending) for photos on June 1st? Your free ride has come to and end.

But fret not! I have a solution. Its a process change that will reduce your photo storage sizes drastically. And **it will make you a better photographer**.

The idea is to add a step that lets you select which all photos should be uploaded to Google Photos - instead of sending everything.

- This will **reduce storage** - lesser photos, lesser MBs.
- This review process will **add intentionality to your photography**. It will make you see patterns - which types of photos you think are good - and which are getting skipped. After a while, your photos will becoming better - you'll take more photos that will get selected in the final cut.

## Step 1: Turn off Automatic Backup

Turn off Automatic Backup in Google photos - if this is On, it sends all the photos you took to Google - increasing storage space - increasing cost.

- Open Google Photos
- Open Account Settings(top right profile photo)
	- ![Account Settings](/assets/google-photos/1-profile.jpg)
- Go to Account Storage
	- ![Acount Storage](/assets/google-photos/1-backup.jpg)
- Turn off 'Back up & Sync'
	- ![Backup On](/assets/google-photos/3-backup-on.jpg)
	- ![Backup Off](file:///mnt/x/Data/www/Sites/github/binnyva.github.io/assets/google-photos/4-backup-off.jpg)

## Step 2: Setup a Review Time

You'll have to set apart 10 minutes once a week to review your photos and decide which ones should be uploaded to Google Photos. Add a recurring calender event at a time when you are generally free. Mine is at Sunday 10 PM.

**Do NOT Skip this step**. If you forget to do this review and manually backup photos, **you will loose your photos if anything happens to your phone**. One of Google Photo's main advantage is to make sure this wouldn't happen. You are forgoing that advantage by using this process.

## Step 3: Review Photos

Every time you get the calender reminder, review and select photos to backup.

- Open Google Photos
- Open Account Settings(top right profile photo)
- Tap on the 'Backup is Off' Menu item - this will show you all the photos on your phone that's not backed up.
	- ![Backup is Off](/assets/google-photos/5-review-option.jpg)
- Select all photos you want to backup - select only the best.
- Click on the upload button at the top.
	- ![Review](/assets/google-photos/6-review.jpg)

There is a hidden advantage to this process - I enjoy the process of going through the photos of the last one week - it gives me a chance to reflect on the past week as well. I hope this happens for you too.
